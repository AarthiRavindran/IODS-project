 **4. Rstudio Excercise1: Tasks and Instructions**  
    *In this excercise, IODs project from Github is forked into my github project. It was then opened in Rstudio to edit the index.Rmd, chapter1.Rmd and chapter2.Rmd and filling the required information. The edited files are saved and knitted for updation. The saved and knit files are updated in Git from Rstudio using commit (everytime note the changes in commit) and push options. Once the updation is done, refresh your github project page and look for the changes you have made.
